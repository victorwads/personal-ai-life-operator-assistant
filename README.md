# Assistant MCP Server

Local macOS assistant bridge for controlling WhatsApp Desktop through Accessibility and exposing fast MCP tools to Codex.

## Purpose

This project exists because direct Computer Use interaction with WhatsApp is too slow and token-heavy for live conversations. The desired model is:

- A native macOS process watches WhatsApp locally.
- It parses the Accessibility tree into stable objects.
- It waits for changes locally, polling every 1s or similar.
- Codex calls MCP tools and receives clean events instead of repeatedly reading the entire UI tree.

The primary use case is active personal-assistant work: WhatsApp conversations, scheduling follow-ups, waiting for replies, and coordinating tasks without model-side `sleep` loops.

## Repository Path

Use the no-space path:

```sh
/Users/victorwads/GitRepos/Personal/AssistantMCPServer
```

Avoid paths with spaces for this project.

## Architecture

The intended architecture has two main layers.

`AssistantMCPServer.app`

Native macOS SwiftUI app responsible for:

- requesting and checking Accessibility permission
- finding WhatsApp Desktop by bundle ID, currently `net.whatsapp.WhatsApp`
- reading WhatsApp Accessibility nodes through `AXUIElement`
- parsing visible chats, unread counts, selected chat, messages, typing state, and compose field
- sending text messages
- showing live logs and raw parser output on screen
- later exposing a local HTTP/WebSocket bridge

`whatsapp-mcp-server`

Future MCP process responsible for:

- exposing MCP tools to Codex
- calling the native app over localhost
- returning stable JSON objects
- hiding raw Accessibility noise from the model
- implementing blocking wait tools such as `wait_for_next_message`

The macOS app should own Accessibility and UI control. The MCP layer should stay thin.

## Current Project

This repo currently contains a generated Xcode project for a minimal macOS SwiftUI app:

- `project.yml`: XcodeGen project definition
- `AssistantMCPServer.xcodeproj`: generated Xcode project
- `Sources/AssistantMCPServerApp.swift`: app entrypoint
- `Sources/ContentView.swift`: basic debug UI
- `Sources/AppModel.swift`: app state and log actions
- `Sources/AccessibilityService.swift`: initial Accessibility permission and WhatsApp snapshot code
- `Sources/LogView.swift`: live log panel

Generate the Xcode project again after changing `project.yml`:

```sh
xcodegen generate
```

Open the project:

```sh
open AssistantMCPServer.xcodeproj
```

## Desired MCP Tools

The first tool should be called once per Codex session:

```text
get_instructions()
```

It should return the operational prompt for WhatsApp handling, including cadence, tone, audio limitations, and when to finalize conversations.

Core tools:

```text
list_chats()
list_unread_chats()
open_chat(chat_id | name)
get_chat_messages(chat_id, limit = 20)
send_message(chat_id, text)
wait_for_next_message(chat_id, timeout_seconds = 300)
wait_for_any_message(timeout_seconds = 300)
wait_for_chat_change(chat_id, include_typing = true, timeout_seconds = 300)
get_chat_state(chat_id)
```

The most important tool is `wait_for_next_message`. It should replace model-side `sleep` loops. The MCP call can remain open while the native app polls WhatsApp locally, then return only when a new message or relevant state change is detected.

## Data Model

Suggested chat object:

```ts
type Chat = {
  id: string
  name: string
  unreadCount: number
  isPinned: boolean
  isSelected: boolean
  lastMessagePreview: string
  lastMessageAt: string | null
  lastMessageDirection: "incoming" | "outgoing" | "unknown"
  isTyping: boolean
}
```

Suggested message object:

```ts
type Message = {
  id: string
  chatId: string
  direction: "incoming" | "outgoing"
  kind: "text" | "voice" | "image" | "document" | "deleted" | "unknown"
  text?: string
  durationSeconds?: number
  timestamp?: string
  status?: "sent" | "delivered" | "read" | "unknown"
  rawAccessibilityText: string
}
```

Suggested chat state:

```ts
type ChatState = {
  chat: Chat
  messages: Message[]
  composeFocused: boolean
  canSendText: boolean
}
```

## Accessibility Parsing Strategy

Prefer Accessibility semantics over coordinates.

Use:

- `AXRole`
- `AXDescription`
- `AXValue`
- `AXTitle`
- `AXHelp`
- known labels such as `List of chats`, `Messages in chat with ...`, `Compose message`, `Send`, `Voice message`, `Unread`, and `is typing`

Suggested parser layers:

`RawAXNode`

Object representation of the raw Accessibility tree.

`WhatsAppScreenParser`

Converts raw nodes into:

- visible chat list
- selected chat
- visible message list
- typing state
- compose state

`ChangeDetector`

Compares snapshots and emits events:

- new incoming message
- outgoing message status changed
- chat became unread
- typing started/stopped
- selected chat changed

## Polling And Waits

The native app can poll locally:

```text
every 1s:
  read WhatsApp AX tree
  parse chat list
  parse selected conversation
  compare with previous snapshot
  emit events
  resolve pending wait calls
```

Future optimization:

- poll faster while a contact is typing
- poll slower when idle
- use `AXObserver` where reliable
- keep `1s` as the default baseline

The important part is that Codex should not spend tokens repeatedly calling `get_app_state` or sleeping. The local process waits and returns a clean event.

## Conversation Behavior Instructions

The MCP `get_instructions()` should eventually return these rules.

Cadence:

- For hot conversations, start by waiting `5s`.
- If no reply, wait `15s`.
- Wait another `15s`.
- Then wait `30s`.
- Wait another `30s`.
- Then stay at `60s` until a reply arrives.
- Reset to `5s` when a new reply arrives in an engaged conversation.
- If the other person is visibly typing, prefer short `5s` waits before replying.

Human style:

- Do not constantly interrupt while the other person is typing.
- Use short follow-ups when silence feels unnatural.
- Keep the tone conversational, interested, and not robotic.
- Avoid over-structured or overly polished replies in WhatsApp.
- It is acceptable to sound lightly anticipatory when waiting for a response.

Audio limitation:

- The assistant cannot reliably understand WhatsApp voice messages unless transcription is added later.
- When needed, ask the person to send text.

Conversation completion:

- When a test conversation is winding down, ask if the person wants anything else.
- Then close naturally with a short thanks.

## Debug UI Requirements

The app should visibly log:

- Accessibility permission state
- whether WhatsApp is running
- selected chat
- parsed chat list
- unread chats
- latest parsed messages
- typing indicators
- raw Accessibility snippets when parsing fails
- events emitted to MCP waits
- send message attempts and results

This log panel is important because WhatsApp may change Accessibility labels or hierarchy. The parser should be easy to inspect and adjust.

## MVP Plan

1. Build the SwiftUI debug app and Accessibility permission flow.
2. Dump WhatsApp Accessibility tree into the log panel.
3. Parse visible chat list.
4. Parse selected conversation and visible messages.
5. Detect new messages by diffing snapshots.
6. Implement text sending.
7. Add a local HTTP server inside the macOS app.
8. Add a separate MCP server that calls the local app.
9. Implement `wait_for_next_message`.
10. Add `get_instructions`.

## Risks

- WhatsApp may change Accessibility labels or node hierarchy.
- Voice messages are not useful without transcription.
- Only visible messages may be available without scrolling.
- Accessibility permission may reset when app signing changes.
- Send actions need deduplication to avoid repeated messages after retries.

`send_message` should eventually return enough information to verify the send:

```json
{
  "chat_id": "example",
  "text": "message sent",
  "observed_status": "sent",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-11T15:00:00-03:00"
}
```

## Build Notes

This project uses XcodeGen. Install path on this machine:

```sh
/opt/homebrew/bin/xcodegen
```

Build from terminal:

```sh
xcodebuild -project AssistantMCPServer.xcodeproj -scheme AssistantMCPServer -configuration Debug build
```

Run from Xcode first so macOS can prompt for Accessibility permission cleanly.

## Accessibility Permission While Running From Xcode

macOS TCC grants Accessibility permission to a specific app identity/path. When the app is launched from Xcode, that binary usually lives inside Xcode DerivedData, not directly inside the repository.

If the app keeps saying Accessibility is not trusted:

1. Run the app from Xcode.
2. Press `Permission`.
3. Enable the app that appears in `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility`.
4. Stop the app in Xcode.
5. Run it again from Xcode.
6. Press `Refresh`.
7. Press `Dump WhatsApp`.

The app logs its current bundle id, bundle path, and executable path so you can verify which exact binary macOS needs to trust.

The `Dump WhatsApp` action checks Accessibility permission live instead of trusting cached UI state, because permission can change while the app is open.
